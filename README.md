# How to group tree list columns in bands in the same manner as in AdvancedGridView


<p><strong>This feature is available out-of-the-box starting from version 14.2<strong>.</strong><strong> SeeÂ <a href="https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/p/AS4236">TreeList - Implement bands in a manner similar to the one provided in AdvBandedGridView</a>.Â </strong><br /><br />For earlier versions:<br /><br /></strong></p>
<p>This example demonstrates how to create a custom tree list with the capability to create bands in the same manner as in AdvancedGridView.<br /> Note that this is <strong>not a full implementation</strong> of bands in TreeList but just an <strong>example</strong> of how it can be done. Some features like Drag&Drop of bands and Column Chooser are disabled because of differences in TreeList layout calculation algorithm which does not support bands.<br /><br /></p>
